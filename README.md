# Project definition

In this project we try to create a Neural Network that is capable of classifying cat images based on a kaggle dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/cat-dataset).

## Requirements

- [Conda/Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)
- [Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

## Environment creation

In your terminal, go into your CatRecogAI folder and run the following command :

```
conda env create -f /path/to/environment.yml
```
